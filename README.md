# Restaurant Customer Storefront (Web-Frontend)

A sleek, mobile-responsive web application designed for a seamless digital dining experience. This frontend allows customers to browse menus, customize orders, and track their dining history.

## How to Access (Customer Flow)

The application requires a **unique session token** to identify the table and session. There are two ways to enter the storefront:

### 1. Scan QR Code

- Scan the QR Code generated by the **Admin Dashboard** (Tables menu).
- This will automatically redirect you to the correct URL with the session token attached.

### 2. Manual URL Access (For Demo)

If you are testing without a physical QR scan, you must append the **Session Token** to the `/order` path as a query parameter.

**URL Format:**
`https://restaurant-web-app-web-frontend.vercel.app/order?token=[YOUR_TOKEN_HERE]`

> **Important:** The system uses the `token` parameter after `/order?` to retrieve specific table information and active order sessions from the backend. Without this token, you will not be able to place orders.
